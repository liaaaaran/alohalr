#'
#' analyze the relationship between the cover of live and dead branching corals and changes in the
#' abundance of different functional groups of fishes following the loss of coral on the fore reef
#' of Moorea due to an outbreak of corallivorous crown-of-thorns sea stars (Acanthaster planci)
#' and a tropical cylcone.
#'
#' A major ecosystem service provided by coral reefs is the provisioning of physical habitat for
#' other organisms, and consequently, many of the effects of climate change on coral reefs will
#' be mediated by their impacts on habitat structure
